# Wireframing
1. Layout Structure
Definition:
The layout structure is the overall framework or skeleton of the page. It defines how different sections (like headers, sidebars, content areas, and footers) are arranged.

Purpose:
Establishes a clear visual hierarchy (what users should see first).

Ensures consistency across pages.

Helps designers and developers agree on the overall page flow.
Example:
On an e-commerce homepage, the layout might include:

A header with logo and search bar.

A main content area showing featured products.

A sidebar with product categories.

A footer with contact info and social links.


Contribution:
By organizing these sections logically, users can easily scan and understand the page without feeling overwhelmed.

2. Navigation

Definition:
Navigation refers to the menu systems and links that allow users to move between pages or sections.

Purpose:

Provides orientation — helps users know where they are and where they can go.

Ensures usability by making important links easily accessible.

Supports a smooth user journey.


Example:
A blog site wireframe may have:

A top navigation bar with “Home,” “Articles,” “About,” and “Contact.”

A breadcrumb trail showing the user’s path (e.g., Home > Articles > Design).

A footer menu for quick access to secondary pages.


Contribution:
Good navigation improves the user experience by reducing confusion and helping users reach their goals efficiently.

3. Content Placement

Definition:
Content placement determines where text, images, videos, or other information will appear within the layout.

Purpose:

Highlights the most important information using visual hierarchy.

Improves readability and engagement.

Ensures balance and visual appeal.


Example:
On a product page:

The product image is placed prominently on the left.

The description and price are on the right.

The “Add to Cart” button is placed directly below the price.


Contribution:
Strategic content placement draws attention to key actions (like “Buy Now”) and guides the user’s eyes naturally through the page.

4. Functionality

Definition:
Functionality in a wireframe represents interactive elements and how users will interact with the page — even if those interactions aren’t fully developed yet.

Purpose:

Defines user interactions early (e.g., buttons, forms, sliders).

Helps identify technical needs for developers.

Ensures usability testing before design or coding begins.


Example:
A login page wireframe might include:

Input fields for username and password.

A “Forgot Password?” link.

A “Login” button.

A note showing that clicking the button will trigger form validation.


Contribution:
Including functionality cues allows teams to understand the user flow and ensures that every action leads to the expected outcome.
# Types of Wireframes
